# _GJDE
## What is this?
This is a database editor made in C# with a few great tools for usability/UI. It is **NOT** in a usable state and should not be used for production. This initial release is just here for accountability to the project to make sure that I continue on it. However I'll be losing quite a bit of free time soon so things will be slower. I plan on using the tool myself for production of my next project, and will continue to update this with both bugfixes and usability.

## Features and Roadmap
You can view things as I work on them here: https://trello.com/b/ztpGlI0P/database-tool

The project ideologically is a way to rapidly develop a tool to edit databases for game projects. The way it supports this is by importing classes/objects from your programming into the tool where it generates the database markup. In short, you select your files and you're good to go. I plan to support C#/C++. The license is MIT so that the tool can be modified to fit the needs of any project, and redistributed to assist modders.
